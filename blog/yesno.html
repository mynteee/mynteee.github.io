                <h2>How I Solved a Rubik's Cube Blindfolded with Just Yes or No!</h2>
                <p>A while back at a speedcubing competition called <em>Canada's Best in the West 2024</em>, I competed in a surprise mystery event that involved solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded but only saying "yes" or "no." What we realized, that some others didn't, was that we didn’t actually have to ask any questions and could just memorize an order. So here’s the strategy that helped us win!</p>

                <h2>Step 1: Finding the White Side</h2>
                <p>First things first, I’d lift the cover, and then my teammate would start saying “yes” or “no” as we went through a fixed order of sides: top, back, front, left, right, and bottom. I kept saying “no” until we hit the white side. When I finally said “yes,” we knew the white face was on the bottom, and we were ready to move on.</p>

                <h2>Step 2: Getting the White Edges</h2>
                <p>Now that the white side was in place, I’d check the edges around each of the layers in a clockwise direction. If I came across a white edge, I’d say “yes”; if not, I’d say “no.” My teammate would move each white edge into place, next to the white center.</p>

                <h2>Step 3: Orienting and Matching the Edges</h2>
                <p>With all the white edges aligned, we moved on to orienting the edges to match their center pieces. Every time I’d say “yes,” the edge was correctly oriented. If I said “no,” my teammate would flip the edge to make it match. It was as simple as that. For each of the edges I would say yes if the color on the side was correctly aligned and no if it wasn't.</p>

                <h2>Step 4: Solving the First Two Layers (F2L)</h2>
                <p>Here’s where things got a bit more interesting. For each F2L pair, I’d start by saying “yes” if the corner was in an F2L slot, and then I’d follow up with another “yes” or “no” depending on the edge. Starting from the back left, I’d go clockwise around the cube, saying “no” until we found the right piece, and “no” again until we reached the correct slot. Once we had the pair, my teammate would insert it into the right place, and if the edge needed flipping, I’d give a “no.” This step repeated for all four F2L pairs until the first two layers were done.</p>

                <h2>Step 5: Getting the Top Corners in Place</h2>
                <p>Now it was time for the F2L corners. For each corner, I’d say “yes” if it was already in the correct position. If not, a “no” meant rotating it once, and “no, no” meant two rotations. My teammate would adjust each corner until all of them were in the right spot.</p>

                <h2>Step 6: Orienting the Top Corners</h2>
                <p>With the corners positioned, we moved on to orienting them. My teammate would guess how many were oriented correctly, and based on my “yes” or “no” feedback, they’d adjust the corners until they were all properly oriented.</p>

                <h2>Step 7: Flipping the Top Edges</h2>
                <p>Next, we worked on the top edges. If an edge was oriented correctly, I’d say “yes”; if it wasn’t, I’d say “no,” and my teammate would flip it using the edge-flipping algorithm.</p>

                <h2>Step 8: Solving the Last Layer (PLL)</h2>
                <p>With all edges and corners sorted, it was time for the final layer. My teammate would guess a 2 look PLL, and I’d give them “yes” or “no” feedback until we got the cube solved.</p>

                <h2>Step 9: Celebrate the Win (and the +2)</h2>
                <p>Finally the cube is solved! We figured that we should just ignore and take the +2 penalty if it occured but we were lucky and didn't even get one.</p>

                <p>If you ever get the chance to try this challenge, I definitely recommend it and if you figure out any optimizations I would love to hear them!</p>
